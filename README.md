# Advent of Code 2023 - Java Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2023 challenges implemented in Java. Each day's solutions are organized in separate directories.

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual coding event that takes place during the month of December. It consists of a series of programming puzzles, with a new one released each day. The challenges are designed to be fun and engaging, covering a variety of topics and requiring problem-solving skills.

For more information, visit the [Advent of Code website](https://adventofcode.com/).

## Directory Structure

The solutions are organized by day, with each day having two parts. The directory structure is as follows:
```
├── day1
│ ├── Part1.java
│ └── Part2.java
├── day2
│ ├── Part1.java
│ └── Part2.java
├── ...
└── day25
├── Part1.java
└── Part2.java
```

Each directory (`day1`, `day2`, ..., `day25`) corresponds to a specific day of the Advent of Code challenge, and within each directory, you'll find Java files for each part of the day's challenge.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ViksyAsenov/adventofcode23.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the desired folder based on the AoC roadmap.

3. Explore the Java solutions for different AoC problems.

4. Feel free to use these solutions as a reference to enhance your understanding of algorithms and data structures.

## Disclaimer

These solutions are provided for educational purposes, and the primary goal is to share and discuss different approaches to solving the Advent of Code challenges. While I have made efforts to ensure the correctness of the solutions, they may not be optimal or the most efficient in all cases.

Please note that solving Advent of Code problems on your own is a valuable learning experience, and I encourage you to attempt the challenges before consulting these solutions.
